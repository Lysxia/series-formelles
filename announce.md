**tl;dr**: I'm [working on an English translation, with additional
commentary](http://github.com/byorgey/series-formelles), of Joyal's
1981 paper introducing the concept of combinatorial species.
Collaboration and feedback welcome!

<hr />

Back when I was writing [my PhD thesis on combinatorial
species](https://github.com/byorgey/thesis), I was aware that André
Joyal's original papers introducing [combinatorial
species](wiki::combinatorial species) are written in French, which I
don't read.  I figured this was no big deal, since there is plenty of
secondary literature on species in English (most notably [Bergeron *et
al.*](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/discrete-mathematics-information-theory-and-coding/combinatorial-species-and-tree-structures?format=HB&isbn=9780521573238),
which, though originally written in French, has been translated into
English by [Margaret Readdy](http://www.ms.uky.edu/~readdy/)).  But at
some point I asked a [question on
MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/171452/examples-of-functors-mathbfset-to-mathbfset-which-are-not-analytic)
to which I hadn't been able to find an answer, and was told that the
answer was already in one of Joyal's original papers!

So I set out to try to read Joyal's original papers in French (there
are two in particular: *Une théorie combinatoire des séries
formelles*, and *Foncteurs analytiques et espèces de structures*), and
found out that it was actually possible since (a) they are mathematics
papers, not high literature; (b) I already understand a lot of the
mathematics; and (c) these days, there are many easily accessible
tools to help with the task of translation.

However, although it was *possible* for me to read them, it was still
*hard work*, and for someone without my background in combinatorics it
would be very tough going---which is a shame since the papers are
really very beautiful.  So, I decided to do something about it! I'm
[making an English translation of the
papers](http://github.com/byorgey/series-formelles)---or at least of
the first one, for now---interspersed with my own commentary to fill
in more background, give additional examples, make connections to
computation and type theory, or offer additional perspective. (And
yes, I checked carefully, and this is explicitly allowed by the
copyright holder, Elsevier.)  I hope it will be valuable to those in the
English-speaking mathematics and computer science communities who want
to learn more about species or gain more appreciation for a beautiful
piece of mathematical history.

This is a long-term project, and not a high priority at the moment; I
plan to work on it slowly but steadily.  I've only worked on the first
paper so far, and I'm at least far enough along that I'm not
completely embarrassed to publicize it, but not much more than that.
I decided to publicize my effort now, instead of waiting until I'm
done, for several reasons: first, it may be a very long time before
I'm really "done", and some people may find it helpful or interesting
before it gets to that point.  Second, I would welcome collaboration,
whether in the form of help with the translation itself, editing or
extending the commentary, or simply offering feedback on early drafts.
