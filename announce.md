Back when I was
writing
[my PhD thesis on combinatorial species](https://github.com/byorgey/thesis),
I was aware that Andr√© Joyal's original paper introducing species was
in French, which I can't read (yet).  I figured this was no big deal,
since there is plenty of secondary literature on species in English
(most notably [Bergeron *et al.*](XXX), which, though originally
written in French, has been translated into English
by [Margaret Readdy](www.ms.uky.edu)).  But at some point I asked a
[question on MathOverflow](XXX) to which I hadn't been able to find an
answer, and was told that the answer was in Joyal's paper!

So I set out to try to read it, and found out that XXX!

XXX So I'm making a translation with commentary.  I hope it will be
valuable to those in the English-speaking mathematics and computer
science communities who want to learn more about species or gain more
appreciation for a beautiful piece of mathematical history.

XXX very much a work in progress.  It's at least far enough along
that I'm not completely embarrassed to publicize it, but not much more
than that.  This is a long-term project for me---I hope to work on it
slowly but steadily.  But I would also welcome collaboration XXX.
