A translation into English and commentary on André Joyal's classic
paper, *Une théorie combinatoire des séries formelles* (*A
combinatorial theory of formal series*), which introduced the notion
of combinatorial species.

This is a work in progress.  The latest version of the PDF
(automatically updated) [can be found here](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/pub/series-formelles.pdf).

To build the document yourself:

1. If you don't already have it installed, install the `stack` tool by
   following the instructions at.
   https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/ .
2. Run `build.sh`.

Step 2 will take quite a while (probably tens of minutes) the first
time, but subsequent runs should be fast.
